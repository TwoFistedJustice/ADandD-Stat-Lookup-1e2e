**Refactor**

**First Task**
Get it working with just a JS function call


**Structural Changes**
The original version holds all the character info in once gigantic object 
and passes that object to every function that modifies anything.

Change it so that only the relevant data is sent for validation.

Have it store data in some kind of DB wheter it is a proper one or just file system.


**ES6**
Change top level vars to consts



**General JS**
Change all function declaration to var or const style
